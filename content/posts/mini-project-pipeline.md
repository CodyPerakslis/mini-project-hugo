# This is the base article for mini-projects

The first mini-project was a pipeline for mini-projects. The pipeline had five key phases.

1. Ideation
2. Planning
3. Execution
4. Review
5. Showcase

So I designed and exuected a pipeline as its own design and execution.

## Ideation

This phase is always ongoing. It is the generating of ideas and collecting of ideas. There is no judgement and no organization. It is just an ever-expanding mess of ideas outside of my mind. 

For this phase, I use a pen and a small notebook. It is low tech but widely available.

> Ideation for this project occured outside the notebook, as its execution preceded its possible collection.

## Planning

Planning occurs in it's own notebook. Planning takes the base idea, expands on what success looks like, than breaks that down into actionable steps. It serves as a budget of time and money, along with a practical guide to action.

> Planning for this project occurred in this manner.

## Execution

Do the tasks, and make the thing.

> This article creation is the final step of execuation, as well as review and showcase.

## Review 

Review constitutes a post-mortem. What went well? What went poorly? What would I do differently with the power of hindsight? 

It is in the review that it is determined what future work, if any, should be done to expand this as a future project.

> The review for this task found that it used time and effort effectively. The idea notebook should be involved more often in my daily activity. I might have chosen a different hugo theme next with hindsight, but I will make this work for the meantime. Future work is to improve the website within the theme, and possible make my own website entirely.

## Showcase 

[This entire website]({{< ref "/" >}}) is the showcase for website building and hosting, a simple matter with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The [github page for the website](https://github.com/CodyPerakslis/mini-project-hugo) hosts the code and site in its entirety. The final bit of the showcase, the bit that is standardized as the workflow, is [this article itself]({{< ref "#" >}}).

> To see this showcase, see [here]({{< ref "#showcase" >}}).
